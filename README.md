Hello there!! I am not General Kenobi, I think you may have noticed. My name is Marcelo Augusto, a young man with a passion for science and technology, passionate about the power they both have to change the world for the better. During my course in higher education I had the opportunity to learn about object-oriented programming and researching further I discovered the flutter SDK and its wonderful power to build applications. Well it was love at first sight, a passion for developing apps was born in my heart. What motivates me is knowing that I can help people with my programming knowledge.
I prefer to write the codes in a clear and objective way (Clean Code is life). I always try to learn new patterns that are being used in the market.
I see the lack of a skill as an opportunity to develop new skills.
